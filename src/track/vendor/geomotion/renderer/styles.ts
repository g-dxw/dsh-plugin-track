/**
 * What the renderer is allowed to know about a layer.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE §14 and ENGINEERING_GUIDE §2 require the renderer to depend on
 * `core` alone — never on the document. Before this file, each scene item carried
 * a live `layer` reference, so the renderer could read *any* document field,
 * including timing and identity fields the evaluator had already consumed. That
 * is the coupling: not a mutation risk (documents are frozen since M6), but a
 * renderer that can silently start depending on document state the evaluator did
 * not intend to expose.
 *
 * These interfaces declare exactly the fields the renderer reads. Document layer
 * types are structural supersets of them, so the evaluator assigns a layer
 * directly with no copy and no runtime cost — the narrowing is entirely in the
 * type system. Verified as a no-op by the render-signature harness: every fixture
 * frame is bit-identical across this change.
 *
 * Adding a field here is a deliberate widening of the render contract. If a new
 * property is needed, add it here first and notice that you are doing it.
