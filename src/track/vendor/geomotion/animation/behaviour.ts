/**
 * The behaviour stack — ARCHITECTURE §06.
 *
 * `value(t) = behaviors( expr( base(t) ) )`. A track says what a property was *authored*
 * to be; a behaviour is a rule that modifies it. The distinction is not academic — it is
 * what M6 found by reading how each of the eighteen bespoke tween fields was actually
 * evaluated. `drawStart`/`drawEnd` was an authored ramp and became a track. `pop` is
 * `overshoot(local / 0.55)`: nobody authored those numbers at any instant, they are a
 * rule about entering. Forcing it into keyframes would have swapped one wrong shape for
 * another.
 *
 * ### Decision 03: linear, and never the front door
 *
 * §06 rejects node-graph-first authoring and keeps the stack linear: an ordered list you
 * can reorder, retime and toggle. This is that list. The graph substrate underneath it
 * is a later concern; nothing here forecloses it, because a graph evaluates to the same
 * `(value, context) => value` shape.
 *
 * Behaviours are **pure and ordered**. Order is part of the document: a scale-up followed
 * by a clamp is not the same picture as a clamp followed by a scale-up, and a stack that
 * quietly sorted itself would make that unpredictable.
