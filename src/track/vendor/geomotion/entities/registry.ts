 * Bengal, forever, whatever a given dataset happens to call it. Facts attach to that id
 * with their provenance, and everything downstream refers to the id rather than to a
 * spelling.
 *
 * ### Decision 02: entities are the join; layers never join data themselves
 *
 * v1 joined by name inside the regions layer, which meant re-fighting the same alias
 * battle for every dataset — and this project reproduced it: the survey reader carried
 * its own table mapping "A & N Islands" and "DNHDD" onto boundary names, invisible to
 * everything else and duplicated the moment a second dataset arrived.
 *
 * Joining once, here, has a second benefit that matters more than tidiness: there is
 * exactly one place for the diagnostics. A name that matched nothing is reported at
 * import, where someone can still fix it, instead of turning into a blank region three
 * steps later with nothing to say why.
