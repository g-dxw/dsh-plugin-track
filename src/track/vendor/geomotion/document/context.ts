/**
 * Map contexts — a lightweight stand-in for v2 §04's scene-owned map context.
 *
 * §04 puts the map context inside a scene, which owns cameras, layers and audio too.
 * Story blocks turned out to carry most of what scenes were wanted for — narrative
 * structure, ripple, a storyboard, a round trip — so the container is postponed and only
 * the part with no other home is built: *what the map looks like during a stretch of
 * time*.
 *
 * ### The shape, and why it survives scenes arriving
 *
 * Contexts are a **top-level table keyed by id**, and a block *references* one. They are
 * not owned by blocks. Two blocks can share a context — a tour that returns to the same
 * view — and, when a scene container is eventually added, a scene references a context by
 * the same id with nothing here changing. Had a block owned its context inline, moving to
 * scenes would mean a migration that guesses which inline copies were meant to be the
 * same thing.
 *
 * ### Partial override
 *
 * A context names only what it changes; everything else falls through to the project.
 * That is what keeps it lightweight — a context that switches the basemap and nothing
 * else is three fields — and it is the same merge a scene would use, so the rule does not
 * have to change either.
