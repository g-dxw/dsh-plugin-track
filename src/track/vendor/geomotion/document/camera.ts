 * The camera node — construction, and the shot row as a derived view.

 * Governing sections: ARCHITECTURE §04 (every property is a track; cameras are
 * observers), §09 (a camera is a node with tracks). See docs/features/camera-node.md.
 *
 * The document stores per-channel tracks; the editor speaks of *shots* — one row
 * carrying all four channels, easing and arc together. Both are kept here so the
 * conversion lives in exactly one place: `cameraFromShots` builds a node from rows
 * (construction and the format-5 migration), `shotsOf` derives rows from a node, and
 * `upsertShot`/`patchShot`/`removeShot` write a row across the channels atomically.
 * The mutation helpers run inside `transact()` — they mutate the draft they are
 * handed, like every other editing helper in this package.
