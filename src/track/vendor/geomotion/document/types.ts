 * What it deliberately does not carry:

 * - **A time window.** A group whose `in`/`out` clipped its children would silently truncate
 *   a layer whose bar you can see, at its authored length, on the timeline — a composition
 *   disagreeing with its own timeline. Children keep their own timing. When nested scenes
 *   land (§10) *that* node type owns a window and a local clock; a group is a container, a
 *   scene is a composition, and conflating the two is what makes precomps confusing.
 * - **A transform.** §04 has nodes inherit transforms from their parents, and they will —
 *   but layers today have no shared transform to inherit (a route has `coords`, a marker a
 *   `coord`, a text `x`/`y`). Opacity is the part of inheritance expressible now, so it is
