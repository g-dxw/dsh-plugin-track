/**
 * The flat node store — ARCHITECTURE §04 Decision 01, ENGINEERING_GUIDE §3.1.
 *
 * "The scene graph is the logical model. Physically, nodes live in a flat
 * `Map<NodeId, Node>` with `parentId` + fractional-index `order`."
 *
 * So: one record keyed by id holds every node in the document — layers and cameras today,
 * groups and scenes when they exist. The tree is read off `parentId`; sibling order is read
 * off `order`. Child arrays are never stored, because a child list stored in two places is
 * a child list that can disagree with itself.
 *
 * What this buys, in the order the design doc asks for it:
 *
 * - **A parent exists.** Groups, scenes, nested map contexts and nested compositions are all
 *   "a node with children", and none of them are storable in an array of layers.
 * - **Patches address objects, not slots.** A reorder is one patch to one node's `order`
 *   rather than two patches to two array positions — which is what makes §16's per-property
 *   CRDT a merge problem instead of a tree-merge problem.
 * - **Deletion is by id.** Every write path had to find an index first; each one was a place
 *   to be off by one.
