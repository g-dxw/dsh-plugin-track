/**
 * The format chain.
 *
 * Governing section: ENGINEERING_GUIDE §3.6. `format` is one monotonically increasing
 * integer for the whole document; each step is a pure `migrateNtoN+1(doc): doc`; loading
 * runs every step from the document's format to the current one, in order.
 *
 * A chain rather than one `migrate()` that knows every shape at once. With a chain each
 * step only has to understand two adjacent formats, which is a small enough problem to
 * get right and to test in isolation. The single-function alternative grows a thicket of
 * "if this field looks old" checks that nobody can later prove is exhaustive — and this
 * project already carries one of those, in the default-filling that runs after the chain.
 *
 * Steps must be pure and must not throw on a document they do not recognise: they run
 * against files this project did not write, and a load that fails is a project someone
 * cannot open.
