/**
 * Format 6 → 7: the scene becomes a flat node store.
 *
 * Format 6 keeps two arrays side by side — `layers` and `cameras`. Format 7 keeps one
 * record, `nodes`, keyed by id, where each node carries `parentId` and a fractional-index
 * `order` (ARCHITECTURE §04 Decision 01; docs/features/node-store.md).
 *
 * Order keys are handed out in one ascending run over the cameras and then the layers, so
 * the layers keep their relative positions — and relative position is draw order, which is
 * the one thing this migration must not disturb. Cameras first because they do not draw:
 * putting them at the head costs nothing and keeps the layer run contiguous.
 *
 * Both old keys are deleted rather than left behind (§3.6.4): two fields meaning the same
 * thing let two readers disagree about which is authoritative, and a stale `layers` array
 * is exactly the sort of thing a later importer would "helpfully" read.

 * into a field of that name on every node. §3.6.4 forbids repurposing a field, and this is
 * the one place where the new shape and the old one collide.
 *
 * So the old meaning moves aside under a disambiguated name, exactly as `tourPitch`,
 * `cameraOvershoot` and `cameraBow` did when those fields stopped being siblings of
 * anything. `migrateTour` in project.ts reads it there.
 *
 * Only for a layer whose tour is still flat: once `tour` is an object, its `order` lives
