/**
 * Format 2 → 3: the two "window with a curve" tweens become property tracks.
 *
 * `drawStart` / `drawEnd` / `drawEasing` on a route, and `dissipate` /
 * `dissipateStart` / `dissipateEnd` on clouds, were the same thing written twice: a
 * value ramping 0 → 1 between two times under one easing curve. That is a two-key track
 * spelled out longhand, and ENGINEERING_GUIDE §126 forbids exactly this — "no bespoke
 * tween fields".
 *
 * Converting them is not only tidying. A window can only ever ramp once, straight
 * through; a track can pause mid-draw, run backwards, or ease each segment differently.
 * Every project gains that the moment it is opened.
 *
 * The remaining tween fields are deliberately left alone. `pop`, `pulse`, `anim`, `fade`
 * and the region tour are *rules applied to a value* rather than values authored over
 * time — behaviours in the §06 sense — and they belong on the behaviour stack, not here.
 * Forcing them into tracks would replace one wrong shape with another.
