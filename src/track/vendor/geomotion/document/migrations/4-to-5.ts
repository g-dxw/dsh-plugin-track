/**
 * Format 4 → 5: behaviour stacks are keyed by the property they modify.
 *
 * Format 4 put one list on the layer and applied it to scale. That held only while there
 * was a single behaviour in existence; the moment `pulse` was added it had nowhere
 * correct to go, because it draws a ring rather than changing a size. §06's pipeline is
 * per property, and this is that shape.
 *
 * `pulse` comes back as a behaviour here rather than staying a boolean. It always was
 * one — a continuous oscillation with no last keyframe to write — it simply needed its
 * own channel.
