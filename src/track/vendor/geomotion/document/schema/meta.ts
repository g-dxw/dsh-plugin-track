/**
 * The node-type registry — ENGINEERING_GUIDE §3.4.
 *
 * "Each node type registers: a zod schema for its props, **property metadata** (label, unit,
 * min/max/step, inspector row kind), and **defaults**. One module per node type in the
 * owning package. The schema-driven inspector reads this metadata; a property without
 * metadata does not appear in the UI — that is intentional pressure to document properties."
 *
 * Two things were previously written down twice, in two places that could disagree:
 *
 * - **Defaults** lived in one big `switch` in project.ts, and the load repair read them back
 *   out of a freshly constructed layer. That worked, but a new node type meant editing a
 *   switch in a file that already knew about seven others.
 * - **How a property is edited** lived in the inspector — 1,600 lines of hand-written rows,
 *   where a control's range, step, unit and label are typed out beside each field. Nothing
 *   related the two, so a property could be added to the model and never appear in the UI,
 *   or appear with a range nothing enforced.
 *
 * Registering both together is what lets a plugin (§15) or an AI proposal (§12) contribute a
 * node type that the editor can already show, without either of them touching the inspector.
 *
 * **Not zod, yet.** §3.4 names zod for boundary validation; this package already validates at
 * the load boundary by checking each field against the *type of its default*
 * (`coerceToDefaults`, "the defaults are the schema"), which is tested and covers the shapes
 * a file can arrive in. Adding a second description of the same fields — one to validate and
 * one to repair — is how they drift. Zod arrives with the plugin boundary, where input is
 * genuinely untrusted and the failure has to be an error rather than a repair, and it comes
 * with the ADR §13 requires for a new dependency.
